# 🎯 Hangman Game – Python

A simple **command-line Hangman game** implemented in Python.  
The player guesses a hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts.

This project is designed to practice **Python fundamentals**, logic building, and file handling.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where:
- A random word is selected from a text file
- The player guesses one letter at a time
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word
- Wrong guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts
- The game ends when the word is guessed or all attempts are used

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Built-in Python libraries only (`random`)

## 🎮 Game Rules

- You start with **7 guesses**
- Enter **one letter per guess**
- Repeated letters are not counted again
- The game displays:
  - Available letters
  - Correctly guessed letters
  - Remaining attempts

---

## ✨ Features

- Random word selection
- Tracks guessed letters
- Shows available letters
- Clear and simple user messages
- Beginner-friendly code structure

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:
- Python functions
- Loops and conditionals
- Lists and string manipulation
- File handling
- Writing clean and readable code
- Implementing basic game logic

---

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels
- Allow full-word guessing
- Improve input validation
- Add scoring system
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
